title:  "Test Coverage"
summary: >
  Martin Fowler posted an interesting article about the use of Test Coverage as a development tool and how it can be misused.
  Like any code analysis tools, the information provided is a guide for developers to help them identify areas of their applications that might be weak, not as a statement of the quality of the application, because "the trouble is that high coverage numbers are too easy to reach with low quality testing."
  I start to get very nervous when sales or management start talking about these quality numbers.
